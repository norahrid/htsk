            <h1>Horse Trials Saskatchewan</h1>
            <p>Described as "equestrian triathlon," horse trials, or eventing, is considered to be the ultimate test of a horse and rider pair's partnership, talent and courage. Eventing consists of three phases: dressage, cross country and show jumping. Each discipline is scored individually, and the competitor with the lowest score (fewest penalty points) wins.</p>
            <p>The first eventing competition was in 1912. The design of the three-day eventing format was influenced by the program of military horses. In fact, the competitors in the first Olympic three-day event had to be active Army officers mounted on military horses!</p>
