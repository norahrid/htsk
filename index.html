      <h1>Horse Trials Saskatchewan</h1>
      <p>
        Horse Trials Saskatchewan is group looking to promote and develop horse
        trials in Saskatchewan. Described as "equestrian triathlon," horse
        trials, or eventing, is considered to be the ultimate test of a horse
        and rider pair's partnership, talent and courage. Eventing consists of
        three phases: dressage, cross country and show jumping. Each discipline
        is scored individually, and the competitor with the lowest score (fewest
        penalty points) wins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first eventing competition was in 1912. The design of the three-day
        eventing format was influenced by the program of military horses. In
        fact, the competitors in the first Olympic three-day event had to be
        active Army officers mounted on military horses!

      <h3>Dressage</h3>

        <p>
          The first phase of the competition, dressage is intended to test the
          horse's gaits, responsiveness to aids, and obedience through a series
          of movements that are memorized from a test. The dressage test in
          performed in an enclosed arena. Judges evaluate each individual
          movement from the dressage test, giving it a mark between zero and 10,
          with zero being "not executed" and 10 being "excellent". The
          individual scores for each movement are totalled up at the end of the
          test.

      <h3>Cross country jumping</h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          The second phase of the competition, cross country is intended to test
          the horse and rider pair's fitness, courage, and jumping ability. It
          usually consists of 24 to 36 solid obstacles over varied terrain that
          test the rider's ability to correctly pace their horse within the set
          time limit. An optimum time to complete the course is set, and the
          pair is penalized for exceeding the time limit or errors such as
          refusals or run outs. The fall of a rider results in elimination.

      <h3>Show jumping</h3>
      <div class="description">

          alt="Rider and horse jumping over a show jump."
        />
        <p>
          The third phase of the competition, show jumping is intended to test
          the horse's stamina and how well the horse recovers after the
          cross-country phase. It consists of a course of brightly coloured,
          lightweight jumps that can be knocked down. It is a speed event that,
          unlike hunter-style jumping, isn't judged on the horse's style,
          manners or movement. Instead, placings are determined by the time it
          takes for the horse to complete the course. Time penalities for
          refusals or knocking down a rail are added to the final time score.
